# Recommendation-system-using-Movie-Lens-dataset

A recommender system is a simple algorithm whose aim is to provide the most relevant information to a user by discovering patterns in a dataset.
An example of recommendation in action is when you visit Amazon and you notice that some items are being recommended to you or when Netflix
recommends certain movies to you.

I am using user based collaborative filtering which is memory based method, The main idea is people with similar characteristic share similar
taste. For example, if you want to recommend a movie to your friend Ujjawal, suppose Ujjawal and I have seen many movie together and we rated
them almost identically. It makes sense to think that in future as well we would continue to like similar movies and use this similarity metric
to recommend movies. 

## Requirements
In order to run this you need to have:
  1. Pandas
  2. Numpy
  3. Matplotlib
  
## Usage
Run the recommendation_system.ipynb
```bash
python recommendation_system.ipynb
```

## Purpose
We created this recommendation system as a part of our CS 386 (IIT Goa) course.
